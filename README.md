* Data was taken from Pitchbook Platform and extracted via web scraping through entrepreneur's LinkedIn profiles.
* Includes differences between funding rounds, funding location, skill comparison across teams, and more.
* Model was built using logistic regression
* 90%+ accuracy across both training and testing datasets.
* Predictions were made on data from real companies
